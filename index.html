	<h2>Bio</h2>
	<p>Believe in yourself and you will be unstoppable...</p>
	<p>This came to mind when I decide at 40 years old to quit my job, and return to school. Cosmetology school. Two years later I am still learning. I'm attending classes regularly to keep up with the trends and new styles. I attended Barbering School in March 2016. I will  be a certified Cosmetologist with a Barber Cross over in July 2016. I'm very new in this industry, but excited about all the changes this industry has to offer.</p>
	<p>I enjoy people. I want to get to know each and everyone of my clients, and hearing about their life adventures. I hope I get the opportunity to be  the person you want to share your stories with!</p>
